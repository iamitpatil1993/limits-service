# default label is master, we can change it to different if we want to specify different branch name.
# Will be handy,if we want to test some functionality on feature branch. Just create feature branch in git 
# repository that spring cloud config server uses with our custom config and set label here with that branch name.
# No need to re-deploy or any other change in spring cloud config server. Same instance can be shared and use by 
# all developers, each one of them will just use different git branch of their own with custom config as they required
# for local testing

# configure token to be passed to vault token. This token will be passed as a 'X-Config-Token' (which is required on
# spring cloud config server if vault profile is active on config server.
# Why client needs/SHOULD to pass authente to vault? -> Tokens can have policy attached to it. So, 
# policy allows access control in vault. So, we can control which service has access to which part of data in vault.
# If we store this token in config server, all services will use same token to get data from vault, so we can not
# define/control access to vault per service. 
# Changed to ID based token to avoid changing token while local testing. Using below command to in vault,
# vault token create -id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -policy="root"
