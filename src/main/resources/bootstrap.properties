# Setting label to be used to fetch config so, 1. spring application name, 2. profile, 3. label will be used to get
# configs from config server. Example URI: http://localhost:8888/limits-service/int/temp
# default label is master, we can change it to different if we want to specify different branch name.
# Will be handy,if we want to test some functionality on feature branch. Just create feature branch in git 
# repository that spring cloud config server uses with our custom config and set label here with that branch name.
# No need to re-deploy or any other change in spring cloud config server. Same instance can be shared and use by 
# all developers, each one of them will just use different git branch of their own with custom config as they required
# for local testing
